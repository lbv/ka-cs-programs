title: SVGLite Demo
summary: >
  A demonstration program for the simple SVGLite class.


  Its purpose is to parse and render images using a small
  subset of the SVG standard. Ideally, this would not be
  necessary at all, because there are other, better, ways
  that are meant to be used for rendering SVG data on a HTML
  canvas, including the `drawImage` method from the canvas
  context object, and some basic support for SVG shapes from
  Processing.JS through the `PShape` type.


  Unfortunately, both of these methods have their
  limitations. The regular HTML canvas approach doesn't work
  too well in _Chrome_, due to a strange bug that taints the
  canvas when rendering data from a dynamically generated
  `HTMLImage` element. Using the `PShape` type from P.JS is
  unreliable, as some basic things (like e.g. the
  `fill-rule` attribute) are not supported.


  Because of this, I decided to simply implement my own
  subset of the SVG standard, supporting the few things that
  I wanted to properly render a few simple SVG files. It's
  of course very limited, but at least it helped scratch my
  own itch :).
