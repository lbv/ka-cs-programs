  A decoder for images in the GIF format.
tags: images, gif, decoder, base64
summary: |
  This is just an experiment to see if it was feasible to
  implement a GIF decoder entirely in javascript, taking the
  opportunity to learn about the internal details of the
  format, and the LZW algorithm used in GIF files to compress
  data. Turns out it *is* quite feasible :).

  It's not really necessary to implement a GIF decoder just to
  show custom raster data in a Processing.JS/Khan Academy
  program, but this was written purely for the fun of doing
  it.

  This program demos the GIF reader on three different images:
  the hand pointer thingy, which has transparency, the K.A.
  logo, which also has transparency and is interlaced, and the
  main photo, which is just as large an image as I could test.

  As you can see, the results are not very sharp, mostly
  because of problems with the GIF format itself, which is not
  very good for anything other than simple images like
  diagrams and the like. For example, for the main photo, I
  had to reduce the palette of colors to just 64; it still
  looks kinda nice, though.

  If you want to use your own images, you just need to replace
  the contents of the "fooData" variables (see the code). This
  data is encoded in Base64, which is a simple mechanism to
  store binary data in a readable format.

  However, if you're just interested in displaying a
  particular image in your program, from any image format used
  in web pages, like JPG, PNG or GIF, you may want to check
  out the `Image2Code` program. You can find a link to it
  below.

  format, you might enjoy the following two documents:

  This program was partly inspired by the "Mona Lisa" program,
  by Peter Collingridge, which produces a very nice picture
  using purely basic drawing primitives. Check it out!
