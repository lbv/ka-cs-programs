title: Chemical Formulas Tool
description: >
  A simple tool that identifies elements from a chemical
  formula, and provides useful information about them.
tags: chemistry, formulas, elements, compounds, jqueryui
summary: |
  I learned some basic chemistry for the first time in my life
  thanks to the Khan Academy. The videos and exercises are
  very useful. However, since I wasn't familiar with the
  periodic table, reading some of the chemical formulas given
  in the exercises was confusing and forced me to go to the
  periodic table repeatedly and basically "hunt" for the
  elements and their basic data over and over again.

  This program is just a small effort towards making that
  experience go a little smoother. Type in your chemical
  formulas, and receive useful information back!
