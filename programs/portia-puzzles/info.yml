title: The Portia Puzzles
description: >
  A collection of simple logic puzzles.
tags: portia, puzzle, portraits
summary: |
  When I was growing up, one of my favourite books was a fun
  text book that was given to me in a math class. It's filled
  with funny commentary, drawings, stories, and it has an
  entire chapter devoted to puzzles. Among all of them,
  perhaps the ones I liked the most were the "Portia" puzzles,
  which consist of finding out the location of some hidden
  portraits, using logical reasoning.

  I wanted to experiment a little with a program that had some
  sort of narrative, and I thought that translating something
  like those Portia puzzles could work well, so here's the
  result.

  I hope you find them fun.
