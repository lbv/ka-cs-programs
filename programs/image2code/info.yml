  A simple utility to turn images into JavaScript code that
  you can integrate into your programs.
tags: images, jqueryui
summary: |
  This is a very visual environment by its very nature, and
  yet incorporating custom images in a simple, direct fashion
  is not currently possible.

  This is just an attempt to simplify a process that
  has been of great interest to many coders in the Khan
  Academy, and has resulted in a number of elaborate (albeit
  creative) solutions in the past.

  You may wonder about the practical implications of releasing
  a tool of this type, when it's somewhat clear that conscious
  efforts have been made before to try to remove this kind of
  functionality from most programs. I do wonder about this
  too, and in case you're interested, you may read more about
  my opinion on the matter here:

  This is just a simple experiment that could be used to
  incorporate relatively small images inside your programs as
  encoded strings. Another alternative, which could result
  more appropriate for certain programs, is MAM: a JavaScript
  library that helps you import media assets from your
  programs, including external images. You can find a link
  below.
