summary: |
  This is just an attempt to simplify a process that
  historically has been of great interest to many coders in
  the Khan Academy, and has resulted in many convoluted
  solutions in the past.

  You may wonder about the practical implications of releasing
  a tool of this type, when it's somewhat clear that the K.A.
  team have made conscious efforts before to try to remove
  this kind of functionality from most programs. I do too, and
  in case you're interested, you may read more about my
  opinion on this subject here:
