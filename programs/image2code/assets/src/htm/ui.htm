    A simple utility that receives an image file, and turns it
    into JavaScript code that you can use directly in your
    Khan Academy programs.

  <h3>But before you continue &hellip;</h3>
  <p>
    &hellip; I'd like to invite you to take a few moments to
    reflect upon the decisions you take every day, including
    the decision of whether to use this program or not, and
    how to use it.

    <p>
      Choose an <em>Identifier</em>, and an image from your
      computer to convert into code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The identifier is a string that will be used in the
      generated code, as part of the name of a function that
      will load your image. For example, if you use
      <strong>MyImage</strong> as the identifier, then the
      generated code will include a function called
      <code>loadMyImage</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is recommended that you use an image in JPG, PNG or
      GIF format, with a size of at most 40KB (the smaller,
      the better).
    </p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Identifier</th>
      <td><input type="text" id="ImgId" /></td>

    <tr>
      <th>Image File</th>
      <td><input type="file" id="FileInput" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <div id="IdError">
    You must use only letters, numbers, or the underline
    symbol (<code>_</code>) in the identifier.
