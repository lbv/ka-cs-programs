  A demo for creating animations from GIF sprites.
tags: images, gif, animation, decoder, base64
summary: |
  Street Fighter II came out when I was a kid, and I vividly
  remember the discussions with my friends about this game,
  and our dreams of one day creating something like that. This
  small and silly program was a lot of fun to create,
  particularly because of the nostalgia.

  This is not even close to being a "playable" game, but it
  could be used as the basis for an engine of some kind.
  Still, I hope to extend it with more interesting features in
  the future.

  This program uses the GIF Reader code, to decode the
  individual frames from a single GIF data stream.

  "Street Fighter II" and related media is copyright 1991,
  Capcom. This is, of course, a non-commercial program with
  the purpose of illustrating programming techniques, made in
  good faith and with the principles of fair use in mind.

  I sincerely hope I don't offend anyone by using these
  sprites in a public program.
