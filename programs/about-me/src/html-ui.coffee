  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Leonardo. I'd like it very much if we
      got to know each other a little better, so here's a few
      things that may help you get a better picture of who I
      am.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy learning <span>n</span>ew things, and I am passionate
      about education. Given this, it shouldn't be a
      surprise if I tell you that I strongly appreciate the
      Khan Academy, and I have the utmost respect and
      admiration for Salman and his team.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work as a software developer. I am very fond of
      computer science and all related fields, although I'm
      not very much into <em>technology</em> as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to read a lot, mostly literature, but also
      philosophy, sci-fi or any other type of reading
      material that I find interesting or entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like music, and I play the bass guitar in a rock
      band with a few friends... Good times.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like sports. I love football (the kind where you
      kick a round ball, but I also enjoy watching the other
      kind from time to time). I've developed an addiction
      to watching football matches from European leagues
      (Spain, England, Portugal, and right now I'm wishing
      they start broadcasting the Bundesliga where I live).
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all I can think of right now. I know it's not
      much, but it's a start :).
