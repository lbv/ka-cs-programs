<p><strong>Tags</strong>: images, gif, decoder,&nbsp;base64</p>
<h2>Summary</h2><p>This is just an experiment to see if it was feasible to
implement a <span class="caps">GIF</span> decoder entirely in javascript, taking the
opportunity to learn about the internal details of the
format, and the LZW algorithm used in GIF files to compress
data. Turns out it <em>is</em> quite feasible&nbsp;:).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not really necessary to implement a <span class="caps">GIF</span> decoder just to
show custom raster data in a Processing.JS/Khan Academy
program, but this was written purely for the fun of doing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>This program demos the <span class="caps">GIF</span> reader on three different images:
the hand pointer thingy, which has transparency, the K.A.
logo, which also has transparency and is interlaced, and the
main photo, which is just as large an image as I could&nbsp;test.</p>
<p>As you can see, the results are not very sharp, mostly
because of problems with the <span class="caps">GIF</span> format itself, which is not
very good for anything other than simple images like
diagrams and the like. For example, for the main photo, I
had to reduce the palette of colors to just 64; it still
looks kinda nice,&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>If you want to use your own images, you just need to replace
the contents of the &#8220;fooData&#8221; variables (see the code). This
data is encoded in Base64, which is a simple mechanism to
store binary data in a readable&nbsp;format.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re just interested in displaying a
particular image in your program, from any image format used
in web pages, like <span class="caps">JPG</span>, PNG or GIF, you may want to check
out the <code>Image2Code</code> program. You can find a link to it&nbsp;below.</p>

<p>This program was partly inspired by the &#8220;Mona Lisa&#8221; program,
by Peter Collingridge, which produces a very nice picture
using purely basic drawing primitives. Check it&nbsp;out!</p>

<h2>ChangeLog</h2><p><strong>Current revision</strong>:&nbsp;rev4</p>
<pre><code>2013-05-09

    * Upgraded components. Added link to Image2Code program.

2013-03-12

    * Reduced size by using regular Coffeescript strings and
      not block strings. Replaced the pointer GIF. Increased
      the number of colors in the photo to 70.

2013-03-11
    * Updated code to fit in 60 columns, fixed minor
      problems.
