  falling snowflakes, and control of the snowman with the
  keyboard.
tags: snowman, drawing, keyboard
summary: |
  This program was originally created to test a few things
  from the programming platform, and has been adapted to reuse
  some JavaScript components in the process. Because of this,
  it includes a few features that may not be very
  beginner-friendly.

  Still, I hope you have fun looking at the code, and by
  taking your time with it, I'm sure you could find
  interesting ways to tweak it :).
