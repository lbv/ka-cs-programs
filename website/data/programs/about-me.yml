summary: |
  I'd just like to share a short paragraph, written by one of
  my heroes (please excuse my rough translation from spanish):

    (..)
    I propose to you then, with the solemnity of life's final
    words, that we embrace each other in a commitment: let us
    go out to open spaces, let us take chances with one
    another, let us hope, along with those who open their
    arms, for a new wave of history that lifts us upwards.

      -- Ernesto Sabato, from "Antes del fin".
